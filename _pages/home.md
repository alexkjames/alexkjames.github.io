I'm a graduate student working with Julien Emile-Geay in the Climate Dynamics Lab at USC. My work is primarily concerned with using time series analysis to improve our understanding the history of abrupt events and dynamical shifts in Earth's climate. More specifically, I'm interested in applying methods from non-linear time series analysis and machine learning to paleoclimatological questions. I'm also motivated by open science endeavours, and am actively interested in building open source tools to make the application of these methods broadly accessible. See the Projects tab for more info about the projects I'm currently engaged with.
