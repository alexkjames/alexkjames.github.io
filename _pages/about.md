I've spent most of my life in Southern California and my interests in hiking, surfing, veganism, and yoga are largely a product of that environment. I do make allowances for other hobbies such as tea and Super Smash Bros Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube that don't necessarily fit the general SoCal archetype, but I try to stay consistent where I can. I grew up in San Diego and completed a B.S. at the University of California Santa Barbara where I majored in physics, minored in philosophy, and graduated with honors. I am now a PhD student at the University of Southern California where I am advised by Julien Emile-Geay. You can learn more about my current research on the home page or under the projects tab.
